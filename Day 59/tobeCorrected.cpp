/*
Write a program that sets up a Date structure (integer for month, day and year) and a 
Person structure (name and birthday â€“ using the Date struct). The program should have a 
function (FillPerson) that asks the user to enter all the names and birthday information. The 
prototype for this function is:
Person FillPerson();
You should also have a function called WritePerson that writes out all the person 
information using the name of the month (as opposed to the integer value) for the birthday 
month. The prototype for this function is:
void WritePerson(Person);
your program should have two Person variables. It should fill these two variables and then 
call a function called WhoIsOlder, which is sent both Person variables. The function 
determines who is older and writes the age status to the screen. (Note: WhoIsOlder should 
call WritePerson twice.
